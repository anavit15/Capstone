Overview: my capstone is an animation of a head flotaing through outer space.

Concepts Synthesized: I used the data extraction from a file/ the internet to get my pictues. 
I then used what we learned in the object oriented design to create my panel to display my imaegs 
and used the paint component to constantly repaint my panel. In order to make the head have a 
random motion, but still stay within the bounds of the panel, I used if else blocks and the Random class.

To run my program, just run the main method of the GIF class.
